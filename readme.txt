`<i class="icon-chevron-left"></i>`

__Shortcode Option__

Don't want to worry about HTML tags?  You can use the shortcode generator to insert the incons in your posts, pages and even widgets to display a Elusive Iconfont icon.

The shortcode generated will look like this >> [icon name=icon-github size=icon-2x align=pull-left color=icon-maroon] depending on your selections.

To generate the shortcode simply look for the Flag icon on your post/page editor and click to launch the generator window, make your selections and click the Insert Elusive Iconfont and you are done.

At this point click the Preview Post/Page button to see the result and when you are happy save your work and the plugin will take care of displaying it on the frontend.
